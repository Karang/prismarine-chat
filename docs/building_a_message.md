# Building a message using `Message` & `MessageComponent`

## 1. Pick a format to follow
### a. Using a translation format.
With this option, you are picking a format from [here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data/blob/master/data/pc/1.16.1/language.json) and just substituting values in for the blanks.
### b. Making a completely new format. (this will be the option covered by the guide)
With this option, you are usually making custom messages, that have colors, bold, whatever, but that don't follow a strict format from a translation.

## 2. Decide the structure
Read [this](https://wiki.vg/Chat#Inheritance) to understand how chat is formatted.
Next, make a basic outline using [these](https://wiki.vg/Chat#Shared_between_all_components) modifiers for style.

For this example, I want my message to look like this:

# DRAFT
